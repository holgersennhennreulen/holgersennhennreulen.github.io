<p><b>About</b></p>
This is my personal webpage, intended to help me organize <!--and document--> 
some of my work as an applied statistician 
(<!--nontraditional publications, like-->preprints, teaching materials, code snippets, ...),<!--blog posts, supplementary websites, software, 
tutorials, workshops, outreach slides, simulation studies)--> 
but mostly <!--as well as organize and document this same kind of--> I want to actually use it as a structured 
list with which I can organize work - the interesting stuff - of other authors in the form of providing links 
to these resources.
<br>
This webpage's name (If I’m doing an experiment to save the world, I better use my prior.) is a 
quote (listed here as no. 41 under 
<a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/gelman_quotes.pdf">http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/gelman_quotes.pdf</a>
) by Statistician Prof. Andrew Gelman from Columbia University, and the short title of this webpage 
(I better use my prior.) is taken from this quote.
